# Introduction to Java

## What is Java?

Java is a **high-level**, **object-oriented**, **platform-independent** programming language. It was developed by **James Gosling** at **Sun Microsystems** in 1995. Java is a fast, secure, and reliable language used for many games, devices, and applications.

More than **3 billion devices** run Java today. It is used for developing **mobile applications**, **desktop applications**, **web applications**, **games**, **database connection**, and much more.

## Java Features

The primary objective of Java programming language creation was to make it portable and platform-independent. Java has the following features:

- **Simple**: Java is easy to learn. It is designed to be easy to use and learn. Java has removed many complicated features such as pointers, operator overloading, multiple inheritances, etc.

- **Object-Oriented**: Java is an object-oriented programming language. It follows the OOPs concepts such as **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, **polymorphism**, **abstraction**, etc.

- **Platform-Independent**: Java is platform-independent. It is not specific to any processor or operating system. It can run on any machine with any operating system.

- **Secure**: Java is a secure programming language. It enables the development of virus-free, tamper-free systems. It does not support pointers, which avoids security problems.

- **Robust**: Java is a robust programming language. It is designed to eliminate the possibility of error-prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile-time error checking and runtime checking.

- **Multithreaded**: Java supports multithreading. It allows you to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously. It helps in the execution of two or more parts of a program at the same time.

- **Portable**: Java is portable. It can be carried to any platform or operating system. Java provides the concept of **bytecode** due to which it is portable.

- **High Performance**: Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because Java bytecode is "close" to native code. It is still a little bit slower than a compiled language (such as C++). However, Java enables high performance with the use of just-in-time compilers.

- **Distributed**: Java is distributed. It is designed to support the construction of applications on networks. It helps to share data and programs.

- **Dynamic**: Java is a dynamic programming language. It supports dynamic memory allocation. Java programs can carry an extensive amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects on run-time.
